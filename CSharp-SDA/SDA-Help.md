## Data Structures
#### Linear Structures
- Lists
- Stacks - only top element is usable
- Queues - only bottom element is usable
#### Tree-Like Structures
- Binary
- Ordered search trees
- Balansed
- B-trees
#### Dictionaries
- Contain pairs (key, value)
- Hash tables
#### Sets and Bags
- Set - collection of unique elements
- Bag - non-uniqie elements
#### Ordered sets, Bags
#### Priority queues / heaps
#### Special thee, interval tree, index tree, trie
#### Graphs
- Directed / undirected
- Weighted / un-weighted
- Connected / non-connected

#### Types of complexity

complexity | notation | description
-- | -- | --
quadratic | O(1) | Constant number of operations regardless the input Data
logaritmic | O(log n) | Proportional but very small number of operations
linear | O(n) | Number of operations is almost same as elements
linear*log | O(n*log n) | Very often appearing complexity
quadratic | O(n^2) | Proportional to square of elements
qubic | O(n^3) | Proportional to cube of elements
exponential | O(2^n), O(k^n), O(n!) | Too complex - 20 elements -> 1 mln operations

#### Multiple variable complexity
