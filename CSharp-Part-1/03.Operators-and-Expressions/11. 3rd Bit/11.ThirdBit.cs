/*
3rd Bit
Description

Using bitwise operators, write a program that uses an expression 
to find the value of the bit at index 3 of an unsigned integer 
read from the console.

The bits are counted from right to left, starting from bit 0.
The result of the expression should be either 1 or 0. Print it on the console.
Input

On the only input line, you will receive a single positiv 
integer - the number whose 3rd bit you must print.
Output

Output a single number - 1 or 0 - the value of the 3rd bit, 
counted from 0 and from right to left.
Constraints

The input number will always be a valid positive integer number.
Time limit: 0.1s
Memory limit: 8MB
