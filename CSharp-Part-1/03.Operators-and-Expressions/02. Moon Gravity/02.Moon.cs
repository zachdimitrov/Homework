/*
Moon Gravity
Description

The gravitational field of the Moon is approximately 17% of that on the Earth.

Write a program that calculates the weight of a man on the moon by a 
given weight W(as a floating-point number) on the Earth.
The weight W should be read from the console.
Input

The input will consist of a single line containing a single floating-point 
number - the weight W.
Output

Output a single floating-point value - how much a man with the weight W 
on Earth will weigh on the Moon. Output all values with exactly 3-digit 
precision after the floating point.
Hint: You can use the built-in .NET functionality
Constraints

The input weight will always be a valid floating-point number, always between 0 and 1000, exclusive.
Time limit: 0.1s
Memory limit: 8MB
Sample tests

Input	Output
86	14.620
74.6	12.682
53.7	9.129
